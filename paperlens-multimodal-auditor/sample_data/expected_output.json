## Interpretation

### Claims Extracted
3 significant claims were identified:
- Claim about 25% improvement (92% confidence)
- Claim about enzyme activity increase (88% confidence)
- Claim about temperature increasing (95% confidence)

### Contradictions Found
2 major contradictions detected:

**1. Improvement Percentage Mismatch**
- Text says: 25% improvement
- Figure shows: 12% improvement
- Confidence: 88% (very high)
- Type: Direct conflict

**2. Temperature Trend Reversal**
- Text says: Temperature increases over time
- Figure shows: Temperature decreases from 45°C to 35°C
- Confidence: 91% (very high)
- Type: Direct conflict

### Audit Summary
The summary provides a human-readable overview: 3 claims analyzed, 2 contradictions found, both high-confidence.

## Usage in Demo

This output would be displayed in the Streamlit UI showing:
1. List of all extracted claims with confidence badges
2. Highlighted contradictions with expandable details
3. Direct links to the pages where contradictions occur
4. A downloadable JSON file for further analysis

This demo output showcases how judges will see the contradictions clearly flagged and contextualized.
